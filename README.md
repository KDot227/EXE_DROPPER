# EXE_DROPPER
Yes ik the code is terrible but this is the first C# app I have ever built in my life and I still don't know what private does or public. If you want to fix something or fix the broken code please make a pr.

## How to use :skull:
If you want the less detections then go into the console app and change the given values and use the ps1 file to build but its kinda broken lmao. \
\
If you just want a cool gui then build normally but go into the one that says FUD_SOMETHING and find the exe that you just built. ngl it gets detected asf cause idk how to use a dif compiler besides roslyn. Thanks for trying it if u even do.
